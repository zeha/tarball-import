tarball-import
==============

Imports tarballs/zipfiles into a git repository.

Assumes that the archives produce a single directory, and the directory will be renamed to "src".

Preparations:

- Make a filelist
- Make a new git repo, create an initial commit
- path/to/import-files filelist


So trivial it doesn't need a license. If you need a license, it's MIT.
